% Purpose: Infrastructure orchestration defining all 15 services with deterministic port mappings and health checks

% Requirements
- Define Docker Compose configuration for complete IE-X stack
- Services: Kafka (9092), Schema Registry (8081), Postgres with pgvector (5432), MinIO (9000/9001), Memgraph (7687), ClickHouse (8123/9009), Keycloak (8080), Dragonfly cache (6379), OpenTelemetry Collector (4317/4318), Prometheus (9090), Grafana (3000)
- Include volume mounts for data persistence
- Include network configuration
- Include environment variables for service configuration
- Include dependency ordering
- Support both development and production profiles

% Output Format
- Generate docker-compose.yml file
- Use Docker Compose version 3.8+
- Include health checks for all services
- Use named volumes for persistence

% Context
This is the infrastructure foundation for running the IE-X system locally or in development environments.

% Dependencies
- None (foundational module)

% Implementation Notes
- Use official Docker images where available
- Configure Postgres with pgvector extension
- Set up Kafka with appropriate topic auto-creation settings
- Configure MinIO with appropriate bucket creation
- Set resource limits appropriately
