% Purpose: Foundational Protobuf schemas defining all message types for Kafka events, gRPC services, and domain models

% Requirements
- Define comprehensive Protobuf schema definitions for the IE-X system
- Include event types: StepRequested, StepCompleted, KnowledgeEvent
- Include domain models: Source, Artifact, EvidenceUnit, ContextCard, Thread
- Define gRPC service definitions: PersistenceService, KnowledgeQueryService, AIEngineService, CacheService, AuthService
- Define Kafka message schemas
- All schemas must be registered with Confluent Schema Registry
- Include mandatory grounding locators (video timecodes, document offsets, DOM paths, image bboxes) for Evidence Units

% Output Format
- Generate a single .proto file at proto/minibrain.proto
- Use proto3 syntax
- Follow Google Protobuf style guide

% Context
This is the foundational schema definition for the entire IE-X system. All services and agents will use these message types for communication via Kafka and gRPC.

% Dependencies
- None (foundational module)

% Implementation Notes
- Use proper field numbering for backwards compatibility
- Include appropriate message nesting for complex types
- Ensure all grounding locators are mandatory fields (not optional)
- Include timestamps and versioning fields where appropriate
